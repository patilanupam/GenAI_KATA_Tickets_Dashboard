Ayesha: Quick update — Login revamp is done. Decision: We will release it on Friday, Dec 6.

Pranav: I’ll take an action item to prepare the test cases by tomorrow.

Riya: I’ll update the documentation by end of day.

Ayesha: Great. Also, please note that the API rate limit issue is still pending. Risk: If not fixed this week, it may affect the release.

Suraj: I’ll check with DevOps on the rate limit configuration.
