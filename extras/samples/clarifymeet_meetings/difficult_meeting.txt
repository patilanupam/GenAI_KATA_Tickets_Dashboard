Aman: Okay, so let’s talk about the release. The original plan was Dec 10, but honestly, looking at the backend delay…

Sara: Yes, the DB migration didn’t finish last week.

Aman: Right. So decision— we push the release by “a week or so.” Not exact date yet.

Ritu: I spoke to QA. They said they can test everything in 3 days if we give them the stable build by Thursday.

Aman: Which Thursday? This week’s or next week’s?

Ritu: This week… hopefully.

Dev: Action item for me— I’ll work on the error retry logic. No date mentioned yet but I’ll try before Thursday.

Aman: Good. And the mobile team? Any updates?  

Shekhar: Umm… We were planning to finish the splash screen fix “sometime next week.” Priority low.

Sara: Another risk — if backend throttling is not fixed, the entire release becomes unstable.

Dev: Also we need an owner for performance benchmarking. Nobody picked it.

Aman: Ritu, can you take that?  
Ritu: I can, but only after Wednesday.

Shekhar: Oh and action—I will also update the release notes, but after the design team finalizes the icons. No due date.

Aman: So many dependencies…  
Risk: Some teams are unclear about their deadlines.

Open question: Should we communicate this delay to leadership today or tomorrow?
