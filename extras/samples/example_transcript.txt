John: Good morning everyone. Let's start our sprint planning meeting for Q1.

Sarah: Thanks John. I'd like to propose working on the new dashboard feature. I think I can have the initial mockups ready by next Friday.

Mike: That sounds good. I'll handle the backend API for the dashboard. My target is to have it completed by January 20th.

John: Excellent. I want to make an important decision here - we're going to move forward with a microservices architecture for the new features. This will give us better scalability.

Sarah: I agree with that decision. However, I have one concern - we might need additional design resources to complete everything on time. The current team is already at capacity.

Mike: Valid point, Sarah. I'll also need to write comprehensive unit tests for the API. That's critical for our quality goals.

John: Let me note that as a risk. Mike, can you be the owner for the testing strategy?

Mike: Yes, I'll own that. I'll draft a testing plan by this Friday.

Sarah: Another task for me - I need to coordinate with the product team on the dashboard requirements. I'll set up a meeting with them tomorrow.

John: Great. Let's also plan for a design review session. Sarah, can you organize that for next week?

Sarah: Sure, I'll send out invites today.

Mike: One more thing - we should consider the database schema changes this will require. I'll document those as part of the API work.

John: Perfect. I think we have a solid plan. Let's reconvene next Monday to check on progress. Meeting adjourned.
