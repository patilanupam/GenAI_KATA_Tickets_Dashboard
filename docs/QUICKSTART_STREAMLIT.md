John: Good morning everyone. Let's start our sprint planning meeting.

Sarah: I'll work on the login page redesign. I can finish it by Friday.

Mike: I'll handle the backend API for authentication. The due date is next Monday.

John: Decision: We will use JWT tokens for authentication.

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### "Connection refused" or "Ollama not accessible"

**Fix:**
1. Check if Ollama is running:
   ```bash
   # Windows (PowerShell)
   curl http://localhost:11434/api/tags

   # Mac/Linux
   curl http://localhost:11434/api/tags
   ```

2. If not working, restart Ollama:
   ```bash
   # Windows: Restart from system tray
   # Mac/Linux:
   ollama serve
   ```

### "Model not found: tinyllama"

**Fix:**
```bash
ollama pull tinyllama
ollama list  # Verify it's downloaded
```

### "Module not found: streamlit"

**Fix:**
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt --upgrade
```

### Port 8501 already in use

**Fix:**
```bash
# Use a different port
streamlit run streamlit_app.py --server.port 8502
```

### Slow processing / Timeout

**Causes:**
- Large transcript (>10MB)
- First run (model loading)
- Limited system resources

**Fix:**
- Use smaller transcripts
- Wait longer on first run
- Close other applications

## 💡 Pro Tips

### 1. Better Transcripts = Better Results

- Mention task owners explicitly
- Use relative dates (e.g., "by Friday")

### 2. Optimize Performance
- Keep transcripts under 5000 words
- Use specific speaker names
- Include meeting context

### 3. Understanding AI Confidence
- **High**: Clear ownership, dates, and context

### 4. Reviewing Warnings
